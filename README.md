## About DBLP Citation Graph 
The DBLP Citation graph contains papers as the nodes and the references made as an edge to the other paper nodes. In addition to this there are features for each paper like venue, keywords, field of study, etc. Using Node2Vec algorithm, the feature embeddings are retireved for the task of spectral clustering.
